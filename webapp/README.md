# **CodeSmile WebApp**

CodeSmile WebApp is a web-based application that performs AI-driven and static analysis of code smells, along with report generation. This README provides instructions for setting up and running the project.

## **Features**
- **AI Analysis Service**: Analyze code smells using AI algorithms.
- **Static Analysis Service**: Perform rule-based code smell detection.
- **Report Service**: Generate and download detailed reports of analyzed code.
- **Gateway**: API Gateway that orchestrates requests across services.
- **Frontend WebApp**: User-friendly interface to interact with all services.

## **Getting Started**

### **Prerequisites**
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (v20+ recommended)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) (v2.12+ recommended)

## **Setup and Usage**

1. **Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/xDaryamo/smell_ai.git
cd smell_ai
``` 

2. **Build and Start the Web App**
```bash
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
``` 

3. **Access the WebApp**

Once the containers are running, navigate to the UI at `http://localhost:3000`.


## **Run app locally**

### **Services set up**
Install dependencies and run services directly: 

```bash
cd webapp/gateway
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
``` 

```bash
cd webapp/services/aiservice
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8001
``` 

```bash
cd webapp/services/staticanalysis
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8002
``` 

```bash
cd webapp/services/report
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8003
``` 

### **UI set up**
```bash
cd webapp
npm install
npm run build
npm run start
``` 

## **Services Overview**

### **1. Gateway**
The API Gateway routes requests between the frontend and services.
- **Port**: `8000`
- **Endpoints**:
  - `/api/detect_smell_ai`: Proxy for AI analysis.
  - `/api/detect_smell_static`: Proxy for static analysis.
  - `/api/generate_report`: Proxy for generating reports.

### **2. AI Analysis Service**
Provides AI-driven code smell detection.
- **Port**: `8001`
- **Endpoint**: `/detect_smell_ai`

### **3. Static Analysis Service**
Performs static, rule-based analysis.
- **Port**: `8002`
- **Endpoint**: `/detect_smell_static`

### **4. Report Service**
Generates reports based on analysis results.
- **Port**: `8003`
- **Endpoint**: `/generate_report`

### **5. Frontend WebApp**
A React-based user interface for interacting with the services.
- **Port**: `3000`


## **Configuration**

### **Environment Variables**
You can configure services using environment variables in the `docker-compose.yml` or a `.env` file:
- AI_ANALYSIS_SERVICE=`http://ai_analysis_service:8001`
- STATIC_ANALYSIS_SERVICE=`http://static_analysis_service:8002`
- REPORT_SERVICE=`http://report_service:8003`
- NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=`http://localhost:8000/api`

## **Technologies Used**
Here are the core technologies and tools used to realize the web app:

**Services**
- **FastAPI**: Framework used for building the backend services with high performance and easy-to-use APIs.
- **Uvicorn**: ASGI server used to run FastAPI applications.
- **Docker**: Containerization tool to package and deploy services in isolated environments.
- **Docker Compose**: Tool to manage multi-container Docker applications, used to orchestrate the various backend services.
  
**UI**
- **React**: JavaScript library used for building the user interface of the web app.
- **Next.js**: React framework for server-side rendering and static site generation.
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime used for running Next.js and managing frontend dependencies.
- **npm**: Package manager for managing frontend dependencies.
